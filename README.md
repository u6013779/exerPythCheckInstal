# Checking Your Python (Anaconda) Installation

## Summary of steps to complete (See corresponding sections below.)

- [ ] Fork this repository so you have your own copy to work on.
- [ ] Clone the repository on your local machine. 
- [ ] Check your version of Python using an Anaconda Prompt and a regular Command Prompt
- [ ] Edit this README.md file on your machine.
- [ ] Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- [ ] Submit a link to this GitHub repository in Canvas.

## 1. Fork & Clone

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Edit your README.md file

* In an editor of your choice (i.e. VSCode) edit this README.md file to add the answers requested in the tables.
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.
  
## Check version

* [ ] Open an Anaconda Prompt. (If you're on a Mac, you should be able to just open a terminal window and run these commands.)
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.
* [ ] Open a regular Command Prompt.
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.

|   Command   |         Result          |
|     ---     |           ---           |
|`python --version` in Anaconda Prompt         |(enter result here)|
|`python --version` in regular Command Prompt  |(enter result here)|

* If you didn't get a result in the regular command prompt, it means Python didn't get added to your path variable.
* It's not strictly necessary. It just means you should run Python from the CLI using Anaconda Prompt instead of a regular command prompt. Or you need to add the path to Python to your path variable.

## Find your path to Python interpreter

* Instruction on how to find the path to the Python interpreter in Anaconda can be found here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-path/
